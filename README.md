# Infinite Terrain Generation and Player Movement in Unity

This project demonstrates the implementation of infinite terrain generation with various obstacles and decorations, as well as a player movement system in Unity. The requirements for this project were met, including creating an infinite world with distinct chunks, obstacles, and decorations. The player's movement is also implemented, and it includes a state machine system for toggling between walking and running.

## Project Overview

### Infinite Terrain Generation

In this project, an infinite terrain is generated using a chunk system. The key features of the terrain generation include:

- Infinite World: The terrain is generated in an infinite world, allowing for seamless exploration without boundaries.

- Unique Chunks: Each chunk has a distinct appearance, making the world feel diverse and engaging.

- Obstacles and Decorations: Chunks are populated with various obstacles like trees, other props can be add as well.

- Fixed Chunk Generation: Chunks are generated consistently, so when the player revisits an area, the chunks remain the same, ensuring continuity in the game world.

- Limited Exits: Some chunks may be limited by walls or other obstructions, preventing the player from moving in all directions.

### Player Movement System

The player movement system is implemented using a state machine. Players can switch between walking and running modes by pressing the "Left Control" key. This system provides a smoother and more dynamic player experience.

## Play Live

To play this project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Unity project.
2. Create an empty prefab for the terrain chunk.
3. Implement the code for generating terrain chunks.
4. Write the code for player movement using the State Machine System.
5. Launch the game and test the chunk generation and player movement.
